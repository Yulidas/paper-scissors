# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors


This project's purpose is to win at least 60% of the time againts bots in the rock paper scissors game, there four bots.

So for the three bots quincy, Kris and mrugesh we used only some algorithms approachs to win against them, but for the abbey is quiete complicated, so we tried to generate some data of the behaviour of the bot, save that data in csv, which  represents a time series data.


In ou case we tried LSTM model, train it with the data and then test it. The results on the training are good but  while testing against the bot, our model wins sometimes and fail sometimes, we tried differents amounts of data, trained on many epochs, tried also to adjust the hyperparameters, but the results remain the same.

The appraoch of using ML or DL is good to win against the bot but still needs a good data and adjusted model.

In this project also we tried other models like autoencoders, transformers, and some Machine learning models like Random forest and so on... but the resutls are not good.
